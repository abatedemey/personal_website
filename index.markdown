In the living room of my NYC apartment, fresh out of my Master's program, I partnered Kav & Andy to start FieldVision, a company would revolutionize how youth sports are filmed. 

At FieldVision, we built an autonomous camera based on the NVIDIA Jetson called the [F1 Camera](/F1_camera). Using Machine Learning, we created an autonomous filming experience that would unlock filming youth sports at scale. 

Eventually, we pivoted and brought these algorithms onto an iPhone, where the power of a sports camera man was sitting in peoples pockets. 

Now - Catch me at [CX](https://www.computex.dev/), where we make it dead simple to deploy AI models.
