In the living room of my NYC apartment, I partnered Kav & Andy to start a company would revolutionize how youth sports are filmed. 

We built a camera powered by an NVIDIA Jetson called the [F1 Camera](/F1_camera). We leveraged Machine Learning at the edge to create an automated filming experience that would unlock filming youth sports at scale. 

Eventually we brought these algorithms onto an iPhone, bringing real time game analytics to peoples pockets. 

Now - Catch me at [CX](https://www.computex.dev/), where we make deploying AI models dead simple.
