# Hi, I'm Abate.

<img  style="float: left; margin-right:30px;" class="alignleft" src="/assets/headshot-resize.jpg" alt="" width="300" />

I am passionate about Robotics, Internet of things, and computer vision systems. I geek out about the interface between hardware and software.

While doing my Masters in Robotics at the University of Bristol (UK), I got an opportunity to volunteer at the [Robohub Podcast](https://robohub.org/podcast/). Since then, I have been conducting interviews with innovators in Robotics across the world.

Nowadays, you can find me in Los Angeles, enjoying the warm weather.
