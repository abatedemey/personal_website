In the living room of my NYC apartment, I partnered Kav & Andy to start a company would revolutionize how youth sports are filmed. 

We built the [F1 Camera](/F1_camera) powered by an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, to film sports games without a cameraman. 

Ball and player detection running locally on the camera cut the costs of filming a sports game by an order of magnitude

Then, we did it again at BallerTV, where we ran the same automated filming algorithms on an iPhone, unlocking the ability to **film youth sports at scale**.

Now - catch me on my founders journey, continuing to create value.
