I am passionate about Robotics, Internet of things, and computer vision systems. I geek out about the interface between hardware and software.

I spent the past four years as the Founding Hardware Engineer at FieldVision. We built a camera that revolutionized the filming of sports. Read more about it [here](/F1_camera).

While doing my Masters in Robotics, I got an opportunity to volunteer at the [Robohub Podcast](https://robohub.org/podcast/). Since then, I have been conducting interviews with innovators in Robotics across the world.

Nowadays, you can find me in Los Angeles, working as the Hardware Lead at BallerTV.
