Prosthetic limbs are often associated with either nude-colored imitations of human limbs or high-tech models optimized for athletes. But what about a third category that captures the fun and imagination of children while still meeting functional requirements? That's where Open Bionics comes in, founded by Joel Gibbard and Samantha Payne. Through partnerships with Disney and Lucasfilms, Open Bionics has created a line of cool and inspiring prosthetic limbs. Joel Gibbard, a robotics graduate from the University of Plymouth, UK, co-founded Open Bionics with the goal of revolutionizing the industry with accessible and advanced bionic arms. Ready to invest in their mission? Joel shares why you should be.
