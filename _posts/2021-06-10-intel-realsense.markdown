Intel RealSense is known in the robotics community for its plug-and-play stereo cameras. These cameras make gathering 3D depth data a seamless process, with easy integrations into ROS to simplify the software development for your robots. From the RealSense team, Joel Hagberg talks about how they built this product, which allows roboticists to perform computer vision and machine learning at the edge.

Through Fluid Design Consultancy, we have come into contact with the RealSense line of products extensively. The ability to add an off the shelf component to instantly give us depth data is a win by itself. The ability to leverage an active, open source community that develops software packages on top of this to extract more value out of the product is magical.
