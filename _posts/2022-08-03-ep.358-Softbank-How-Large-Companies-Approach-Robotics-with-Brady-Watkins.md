SoftBank Robotics aims to create value for humanity through robotics and AI technology. Their focus is on scalable industries with gaps in task-to-service value, such as the cleaning industry, which is dominated by a workforce. Whiz, an indoor, mobile, autonomous vacuum cleaner, is SoftBank Robotics' product that best personifies their mission. By automating single tasks, the workforce can uplevel itself and evolve from a transformation perspective, while providing better and safer environments for the workforce. SoftBank Robotics provides a proof of performance and creates efficiency, allowing for a more frequent clean and creating less risk of an unsafe environment. This creates opportunities in industries like hospitality, senior living, and education.
