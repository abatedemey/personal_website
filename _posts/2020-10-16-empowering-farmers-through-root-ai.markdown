Josh Lessing, co-founder and CEO of Root AI, discusses a system they are developing that tracks data on the farm and autonomously harvests crops using delicate grippers and computer vision. Lessing talks about the path they took to build a product with good market fit and how they brought a venture capital backed startup to market.
