I interview Edward Neff, founder of <a href="www.smac-mca.com">SMAC Corporation</a>. Mr. Neff discusses breakthroughs in his company that allow them to develop linear actuators compact enough to be used to actuate robotic fingers. Companies like Apple and Samsung push for the development of robotic fingers to perform lifelike tests on their phones.

The robotic fingers developed using SMACâ€™s linear servo motors simulate a button press on a screen by employing a strong downwards force, as well as small sideways forces tangential to the screen. This mimics a realistic way that people interact with their touchscreens. The robotic fingers can also gently bump into surfaces, pull, and push objects. Other applications for these fingers include electronic circuit board assembly, and screwing bottle caps onto bottles.
