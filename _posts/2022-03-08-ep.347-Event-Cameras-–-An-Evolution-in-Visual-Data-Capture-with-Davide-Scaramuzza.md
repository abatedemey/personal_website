Davide Scaramuzza discusses Event Cameras, a step-change in camera innovation that has the potential to accelerate vision-based robotics applications. Event Cameras operate differently from traditional cameras, unlocking benefits such as extremely high-speed imaging, removal of the concept of "framerate", and low power consumption.

One of my favorite emerging technologies with a ton of promise for perception.
