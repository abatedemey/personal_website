I interview Andrew Neil Stein from <a href="https://www.anki.com/en-us">Anki</a> about their engaging robot, <a href="https://www.anki.com/en-us/cozmo">Cozmo</a>. Cozmo is a lifelike, palm sized robot that recognizes people and objects around him and plays games with them. Cozmo is unique in that a large amount of development has been implemented to make his animations and behavior feel natural, in addition to focusing on classical robotic elements such as computer vision and object manipulation.
