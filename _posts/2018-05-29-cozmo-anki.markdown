I interview Andrew Neil Stein from <a href="https://www.anki.com/en-us">Anki</a> about their engaging robot, <a href="https://www.anki.com/en-us/cozmo">Cozmo</a>. Cozmo is a lifelike, palm sized robot that recognizes people and objects around him and plays games with them. Cozmo is unique in that a large amount of development has been implemented to make his animations and behavior feel natural, in addition to focusing on classical robotic elements such as computer vision and object manipulation.

He has contributed to several core systems of the product, including vision, cube manipulation, animation streaming, localization, high-level behaviors, and low-level actions.
