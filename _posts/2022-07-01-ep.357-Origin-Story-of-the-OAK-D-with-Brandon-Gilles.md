Luxonis' Founder and CEO, Brandon Gilles, shares how his team created the versatile OAK-D perception platform. With expertise in embedded hardware and software, Gilles leveraged his experience from Ubiquiti, a company that transformed networking with network-on-a-chip architectures. The OAK-D, which uses Intel Myriad X for power-efficient perception computations, offers more than just depth sensing capabilities. It also provides access to open-source computer vision and AI packages pre-calibrated to the optics system. Thanks to its system-on-a-module design, Luxonis can easily produce various hardware platform variations to fit customers' needs. Stay tuned for more updates.
