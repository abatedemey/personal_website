<p>David Mindell, co-founder of Humatics, discusses a system they developed that can detect the location of a special tracking device down to a centimeter level accuracy. They are currently developing a device to detect location down to a millimeter level accuracy. This solves a core problem of localization for robots. David discusses the technology behind these products and their applications.</p>
