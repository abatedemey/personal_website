<p>I interview Peter Harris from HighRes Biosolutions about <a href="https://content.yudu.com/web/fiqy/0A42big/drugdiscoveryfall17/html/index.html?page=64&amp;origin=reader">automation in the field of drug discovery</a>. At HighRes Biosolutions they are developing modular robotic systems that work alongside scientists to automate laboratory tasks. Because the requirements of each biomedical research laboratory are so varied, the robotic systems are specifically tailored to meet the requirements of each lab.</p>
