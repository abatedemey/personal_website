<p>I interview three speakers from the Artificial Intelligence and Drone tracks at RoboUniverse San Diego and the Inside 3D Printing Conference.</p>

<h3>Dr. Douglas Stow</h3>
<p>Dr. Douglas Stow discusses the <a href="https://geog.sdsu.edu/Research/Projects/TS_Detection/">use of drones</a> in analyzing large scale changes over time in terrains, and its applications in determining the extent of damage after a natural disaster.</p>

<p>Dr. Stow is a Professor of Geography at San Diego State University (SDSU) and has been on the faculty for 33 years. He has worked in the remote sensing field for almost 40 years and his research focuses on multitemporal image analysis.</p>

<h3>Dr. Eugene Izhikevich</h3>
<p>Dr. Eugene Izhikevich discusses how Brain Corporation converts manually driven industrial machines into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4QkyHapXSA">autonomous robots</a>.</p>

<p>Known for his contributions to the theory of spiking networks, in 2005 Dr. Izhikevich implemented the world’s largest thalamo-cortical model. It simulated one hundred billion neurons and one quadrillion synapses - the same number as the human brain.</p>

<h3>Cullen Hilkene</h3>
<p>Cullen Hilkene discusses how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-5NS1bCGZk">3Diligent</a> optimizes the work flow and communication layer between a diverse set of 3D print vendors and their customers.</p>

<p>Cullen Hilkene is CEO of 3Diligent, “the 3D Printing Partner for Every Business.” 3Diligent is a web-based rapid manufacturing service described as “Uber meets Amazon for 3D Printing, CNC Machining, and Molding and Casting.”</p>
