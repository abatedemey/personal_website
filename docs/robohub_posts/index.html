<p>Rick Faulk, CEO of <a href="http://www.locusrobotics.com/">Locus Robotics</a>, talks with me about warehouse automation with collaborative robots. At Locus Robotics, they increase the productivity of workers in e-commerce warehouses by using robot helpers to transport items that are passed to them by the workers. The lightweight autonomous robots move at a similar pace to their co-workers, use LIDAR and computer vision to detect people and avoid collisions. This allows people to share the warehouse floor with the robots. The collaborative robotic system is lightweight and can be adapted to existing warehouses with minimal alterations.

<p>I interview Edward Neff, founder of <a href="www.smac-mca.com">SMAC Corporation</a>. Mr. Neff discusses breakthroughs in his company that allow them to develop linear actuators compact enough to be used to actuate robotic fingers. Companies like Apple and Samsung push for the development of robotic fingers to perform lifelike tests on their phones.</p>

<p>The robotic fingers developed using SMAC’s linear servo motors simulate a button press on a screen by employing a strong downwards force, as well as small sideways forces tangential to the screen. This mimics a realistic way that people interact with their touchscreens. The robotic fingers can also gently bump into surfaces, pull, and push objects. Other applications for these fingers include electronic circuit board assembly, and screwing bottle caps onto bottles.</p>

<p>In this episode, I interview <a href="http://blog.xemo.io/author/jeff/">Jeff Sprenger</a>, founder of the startup <a href="http://www.xemo.io/">Xemory</a> in Vermont, USA. At Xemory they are developing a robot simulation game called Xemo, where players learn to animate virtual robots.</p>

<p>Complex motion at each joint is broken down into its more fundamental components, called degrees of freedom. Players are faced with the challenge of controlling the several degrees of freedom to recreate lifelike motions such as crawling, walking, jumping, and even dancing. These challenges are similar to the ones faced by roboticists trying to develop lifelike, robust and balanced motions for legged robots.</p>

<p>Sprenger discusses the unique ways different age groups and genders interact with the software. Through incorporating feedback from the students, Sprenger adds new activities and challenges to keep students engaged and challenged, improving their understanding of robot control.</p>

<p>I interview <a href="http://www.bene-guido.eu/wordpress/">Guido De Croon</a> about Evolutionary Robotics and its use to design behaviors for flying robots. We discuss a <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7412843&amp;filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A7412841%29">recent paper</a> by Kirk Schepe et al., in which the DelFly UAV robot learns to fly through an open window when trapped inside a room thanks to a controller optimized using a Genetic Algorithm. The controller is programmed using a Behavior Tree Framework, which is more intuitive and adaptable than the traditional Neural Network framework. This helps the user to manually adapt the controller to handle the differences between the simulation and the real world. Guido then discusses the challenges and benefits of using Evolutionary Robotics to learn robot behaviors.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academic/tony-prescott">Tony Prescott</a>, Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience and Director of the Sheffield Center of Robotics believes that [tweetquote]the medical industry could be at the forefront of changing the public perception of robotics. Why?[/tweetquote] Because this is an industry that already understands how paramount it is, when dealing with the elderly, disabled and ill, to provide a service that is helpful, friendly and nonthreatening.<!--more--></p>

<p>Speaking this week at <a href="https://www.re-work.co/workshops/future-of-robotics">RE.WORK</a> – an event that explores the challenges of commercializing robotics – Prescott recalled the fear people had in the 90s about the coming of the Internet. Similarly, he said, reporters often ask him: “When will robots take over the world?” The question has perhaps become a cliché among roboticists, but in his presentation (aptly titled “Robots that know themselves will make better carers”) Prescott suggested that much can be learned from neuroscience and psychology to improve the safety and effectiveness – and by extension the public perception – of human-robot interaction.</p>

<p>The aging population is increasing rapidly, and there are not enough caregivers to satisfy the growing demand. It is projected that <a href="http://www.fitforworkeurope.eu/chronic-conditions.htm">by 2060, there will be one dependent person for every working person in the EU</a>. Per visit, caretakers have limited time in which to interact the elderly people in their care, and time must be divided between aiding with personal hygiene tasks, ordering/preparing food, and one-on-one conversation time. As such, seniors must often make difficult decisions to prioritize the services they wish to receive from caregivers.</p>

<p>Prescott said that personal robots could aid seniors with time consuming household tasks such as making a pot of tea, reaching for the salt, opening a jar, or microwaving food – tasks that could be frustrating if you have to wait around for help. Personal hygiene tasks such as showering or using the toilet can create an embarrassing dynamic between the elderly and the caretaker, and so also make ideal tasks for robot care assistants.</p>

<p>Prescott points out that the role of a robot should be to assist the senior and the caregiver, not to take over.  “Robots can help caregivers, not by replacing them, (but by working with them).”  With the aid of personal robots, caretakers could spend more time engaging in one-on-one conversation with the elderly, providing valuable social interaction.</p>

<p>And yet we cannot stop people from getting personally attached to the items they own, Prescott explains. People like to glue fur to their Roombas to make them feel more like pets, and robot companions like the Paro have been shown to induce relaxation, reduce stress, and stimulate communication between patients and caregivers. The important distinction to remember, suggested Prescott, is that the companionship people feel toward their robots is more in line with how they feel toward their pets, and the need for human companionship will always remain critical.</p>

<p>If we can learn to design robots that can work as part of a care team, public perception of robots is sure to change.</p>
